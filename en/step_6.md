## Catch all the ghosts

+ Now use all the commands you have learned in the last step and this step, to move around and find, catch and quarantine as many ghosts as you can find.

Here's a reminder of all the commands you need to navigate the terminal:

[[[command-line-navigation]]]

Tips:
1. Remember to copy the ghosts to the quarantine folder before removing them
2. Navigate to your quarantine folder to see how many ghosts you've caught
3. If a directory's name has more than one word in it (for example **My Movies**), to navigate into it use a `\` after the first word (`cd My\ Movies`)
4. There are 7 ghosts in total, can you catch them all?

Once you have caught as many ghosts as possible, collect your treasure in the next step!
