First, you will be introduced to your mission which will be to hack the terminal to find all the Pacman ‘ghosts’ planted in the Terminal. After figuring out which ghosts are viruses by viewing files in the terminal, you'll delete the corrupted files, solve the riddle left by Pacman, and then create your own Cybersecurity directory.
