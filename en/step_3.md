## Your mission

For this project, you will be Pacman:

Instead of just being a hungry yellow dot, you are also an ethical hacker. However, there is a huge problem with your computer system. It is being attacked by nasty viruses. These viruses are the Pacman ghosts:

The command line is a text interface for your computer. It's a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer's operating system to run.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Finder on Mac OS or Windows Explorer on Windows. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based.

The advantage of using the command line is its power. You can run programs, write scripts to automate common tasks, and combine simple commands to handle difficult tasks - making it an important programming tool.

The commands used in this treasure hunt is for unix-based systems such as Linux and Mac OS X. An appendix of all commands taught in this course is available here.
