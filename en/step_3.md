## Start the treasure hunt

To start the treasure hunt, you will need to download a file from the internet which will unleash the Pacman Ghosts.

You can easily download anything and open it from the terminal using **bash**. Bash is a program that listens to your commands and does what you tell it to do. Hackers are concerned with problems in computer systems and programs, and they need to give commands to find these problems and fix them. Therefore, they need to be good at using commands in programs like bash.

+ To access bash, make sure you have opened a terminal window.

  In the terminal, you will see `$`. This is called a **shell prompt**. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.

+ After the `$` or shell prompt, type or copy and paste:
  ```
  wget -O - http://rpf.io/pacmanstart | bash
  ```
  You will see a lot of text appear in the terminal, this means it is downloading the files to start the treasure hunt.

+ Press `Ctrl l` to clear the terminal

Next, learn how to navigate the command line so you can start finding and catching ghosts.
